# PERSONAL-Public

#####
This repository has personal projects that will be available to the public to view and download. This repo was created mainly to hold myself accountable for creating personal projects and hopefully get myself to start creating a project portfolio.

Whenever a project is completed to a suitable extent it will be added to the repo.

Chances are the first project under each language will be a simple "Hello, World!" program since I am also trying to learn more languages.

I will have the programs ordered by the time they were completed rather than difficulty, however the difficulty will most likely scale the further into a language the project is.
